# libft_take2
libft is a very first `<42/Cadet/Project>` to maipulate the `LIBC` and Additions.
This will make Cadets to understand how to build their own libraries and so on.
This library also can be used for ft_printf and some of the next orbital projects.
For this REPO, will include the `GNL` and `ft_printf` for further usages.

## Prerequisites
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine.
* In case of Windows `<WSL>` may be your preferred solution.
* Your preferred IDE `<vscode/vim/...>`
* `<clang>` and `<gcc>` to compile the source codes.
* `<leaks or valgrind>` to verify the code is working properly without leaks.

## Usage
* put this structure into the libft folder in your destination project
* adding `make -C $(LIBFT_DIR)` in your Make file as well as include the libft in your compiling command e.g. 
`-L $(LIBFT_DIR) -lft`
